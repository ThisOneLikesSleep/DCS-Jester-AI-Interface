# DCS-Jester-AI-Interface
Program I wrote a year ago that allows you to use a push-to-talk button to record your speech, which would be turned into speech, categorized into a command and sent to Jester AI for the F-4 module of DCS World. 
For the voice recognition I've used the 'small.en' model which works to a reasonable degree without taking up too much VRAM - CPU can't process speech in a timely manner - but still might need some prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy. 
interface.js is used to interact with the game but isn't too functional as I've come across issues with networking problems that I don't have enough expertiese to handle.
